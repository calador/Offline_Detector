# Offline Detector

A software solution that alerts you when a monitored system goes offline/online because of shutdown, restart, or network disconnect. Uses a minimally invasive taskbar corner icon that uses as few system resources as possible. 

Goals:
  Install using an optional local or server-hosted script to inject options without manually entering info during install.
     Hidden option to install as admin for system monitors
  Optionally password protect software from inadvertant shutdown yet still allow system to be rebooted for updates.
  Admin program that can be loaded on SysAdmin systems for multiple admins.
